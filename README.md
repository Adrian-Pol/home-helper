# <center style="color:red"> About </center> 
The idea behind is to bring everything I need to track into one place. I was tired of keeping everything scattered across different storage platformsâ€”things like gym progress, photos, diet plans, and diary entries. So, I decided to create this project to keep everything organized in one location.

For now, the project is focused on:

* Daily diary entries with the ability to upload and view photos.

* Goal tracking (dreams, milestones) with a function to organize them.

* Gym/weight loss progress tracking.

* Diet plan management.

* A calendar to track important dates and entries.

Technologies Used:

Backend: Python, FastAPI, SQLAlchemy, PostgreSQL

Frontend: React

Authentication: JWT, Sessions

Storage: Local file storage and database syncing

Currently, the app includes:

* User authentication (register, login).

* Basic functionality for creating, viewing, and editing diary entries.

* Simple goal tracking with progress updates.

* Tracking gym/weight loss progress.

Here's what I'm currently working on:

* Testing and Type Checking: Implementing tests using PyTest and integrating type-checking to ensure code quality and consistency.

* Continuous Improvement: Constantly improving and adding new features based on user feedback and my own learning.

* API Enhancements: Extending  endpoints for better data manipulation and efficiency.

* Frontend Enhancements: Improving the user interface and adding responsive elements for a better  experience.

* Database and Storage: Working on syncing diary entries, photos, and other data between local storage and the  database.

* Security Improvements: Focusing on better security practices
